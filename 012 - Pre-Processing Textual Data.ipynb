    "So before we can build learning models that work with Textual data we need to learn how to take text and convert it into a form that machines will understand and can learn from.\n",

    "This workbook introduces you to the key concepts related to working with Text in Machine Learning and we will cover topics such as:\n",
    "- Tokenisation\n",
    "- Lemmintisation\n",
    "- Embedding\n",
    "- Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "The form the basis of pre-processing in any textual or Natural Language Processing work."

For this workshop you don't really need to pay that much attention to this step (but you do need to execute the cell) since we are focusing on building models. However the following is a description of what this cell does that you can read if you are interested.\n",
