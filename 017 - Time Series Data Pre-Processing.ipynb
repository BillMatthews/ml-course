    "## What is Time Series Data\n",
    "Time Series Data is a series of data points ordered in time. Time Series data can have some interesting properties such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Trends__ where there is a general increase, decrease or steady state to the values over time or during period. An example of this might be the graph of the FTSE 100 share index which generally shows an upward trend.\n",
    " \n",
    " __Seasonality__ where there are distinct periodic fluctuations with similar pattersn. An example of this might be the mean daily temperature over a 5 year period would likely show regular period of increased temperatures occuring during summer periods.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Why is Time Series Data interesting?\n",
    "Data that forms Time Series is of interest since it can be used to forecast future events. For example:\n",
    " - if we can reliabily forecast the price of a stock from recent historical data then we can potentially make money\n",
    " - if we can forecast where a hurricane will make landfall then we can make preprations and save lives.\n",
    " \n",
    " Each of these examples, has value and it is likely that the historical data is a good indicator for a future forecast.\n",

    " In your teams, list out some examples of Time Series Data where you think it might be valuable to be able to forecast future values (such as the two given above). \n",

    " - What is the value in being able to forecast future values/events for this dataset?\n",
    " - What data is likely to be related to the time-series that might help with a forecast?  \n",
    "     - For example, in stock market prediction, historical stock info could be suplemented with stock market prices of related stocks or indexes such as the FTSE 100.\n",
